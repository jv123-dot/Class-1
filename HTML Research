HTML Semantic tags are both important and useful for a variety of reasons

1. They make it easier to review code (yours or someone else's).
2. It's beneficial for websites to use them because search engines utilize that information
to decide if your content is relevant or not to what was searched.
4. People who have impairments like blindness use readers to help them navigate -
and by using the semantic tags correctly it helps the assistance programs work better

inline can go side by side only taking up the space that's needed. Each HTML element
has its own mode
